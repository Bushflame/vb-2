# Smooth Scroll Responsive Navigation
The build system I've used is my usual Parcel c/w Stylus
## The Navigation
The smooth scroll navigation is written in vanilla js. No other libraries, such as jquery are used
## Styling
The styling is based around stylus and its various plugins
nib takes care of the vendor prefixes and gradients
rupture enables easy media queries
## Components
The flexbox layout in section 1 begins life with 6 rows of 1 column. Then forms 3 rows of 2, before forming 2 rows of 3 on wide screens
The grid system of section 2 starts out at 8 rows of 1, then 4 rows of 2, and finally 2 rows of 4
